This is the Apollo Server code for the Botswana International University of Science and Technology's (BIUST) movement control system. It creates a GraphQL server that resolves to a Firestore database. It is served on the Google App Engine.

PROBLEM: People having to register manually when getting temperature taken as they enter a building in the BIUST campus. Leads to long lines and increased risk of getting Covid-19.

SOLUTION: An automated system that scans an individual's unique details, picks up his/her data from the database, and then only temperature is logged into the system by the guard in control.
